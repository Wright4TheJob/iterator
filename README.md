# Iterator

This is a small binary to count up over an arbitrary character set. This can be used for generating ID numbers with a large number of base characters tailored to your needs. This generally includes standard numerical IDs, Hex codes, full alphanumeric, or any other combination. 

The valid characterset is hard-coded currently. The intent is to have options to generate a number of next IDs, the single next ID given the last ID, or cycle and sort through them.
